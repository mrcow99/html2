       <blockquote>The Kon-Tiki expedition was a 1947 journey by raft across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the
        Polynesian islands, led by Norwegian explorer and writer Thor Heyerdahl.
        The raft was named Kon-Tiki after the Inca god Viracocha, for whom "Kon-Tiki" was said to be an old name.
        Heyerdal's book on the expedition was entitled The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas
        A 1950 documentary film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. A 2012 dramatized feature film was nominated for
        The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

        The Kon-Tiki expedition was funded by private loans, along with donations of equipment from the United States Army. 
        Heyerdahl and a small team went to Peru, where, with the help of dockyard facilities provided by the Peruvian authorities,
        they constructed the raft out of balsa logs and other native materials in an indigenous style as recorded in illustrations 
        by Spanish conquistadores. The trip began on April 28, 1947. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft for 101 days over
        6,900 km (4,300 miles) across the Pacific Ocean before smashing into a reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947. 
        The crew made successful landfall and all returned safely.
